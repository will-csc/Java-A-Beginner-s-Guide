Chapter 14 Self Test

1. What is the lambda operator?
R: Is a function anonymus function used to simply normal functions

2. What is a functional interface?
R: A functional interface is a interface with one and only one method

3. How do functional interfaces and lambda expressions relate?
R: You use functional interface as a declaration in order to use the lambda expressions

4. What are the two general types of lambda expressions?
R: Stateless and Stateful

5. Show a lambda expression that returns true if a number is between 10 and 20, inclusive.
R: (x) -> ( x > 9 && x < 21)

10. Can a lambda expression use a local variable? If so, what constraint must be met?
R: Yes it can, but it must be constant

11. If a lambda expression throws a checked exception, the abstract method in the functional interface must have a throws clause that includes that exception. True or False?
R: True

12. What is a method reference?
R: It is a method who can reference another one without it exists

13. When evaluated, a method reference creates an instance of the ____________ ___________ supplied by its target context.
R: interface funcional

14. Given a class called MyClass that contains a static method called myStaticMethod( ), show how to specify a method reference to myStaticMethod( ).
R: Classe::métodoEstatico

15. Given a class called MyClass that contains an instance method called myInstMethod( ) and assuming an object of MyClass called mcObj, show how to create a method reference to myInstMethod( ) on mcObj.
R: objeto::métodoDeInstância

17. How is a constructor reference specified?
R: Classe::new

18. Java defines several predefined functional interfaces in what package?
R: java.util.function
