1. Given this fragment,
class X {
	private int count;
is the following fragment correct?
	class Y {
		public static void main(String args[]) {
			X ob = new X();
			ob.count = 10;
R: Wrong, count is private

2. An access modifier must __________ a member’s declaration.
R: Precedes

5. Is the following fragment correct?
class X {
	int meth(int a, int b) { ... }
	String meth(int a, int b) { ... }
R:Wrong, the function "meth" must return the same types

7. If all objects of a class need to share the same variable, how must you declare that variable?
R: declare it static

8. Why might you need to use a static block?
R: To run a block of code when you instanciate a class

9. What is an inner class?
R: A class inside another class

10. To make a member accessible by only other members of its class, what access modifier must be used?
R: private

11. The name of a method plus its parameter list constitutes the method’s _______________.
R: signature

12. An int argument is passed to a method by using call-by-_______________.
R: value

14. Can a varargs method be overloaded?
R: Yes

15. Show an example of an overloaded varargs method that is ambiguous.
R: 
public class AmbiguousOverload {
    
    // First overloaded method with varargs of int
    static void display(int... values) {
        System.out.println("int varargs method");
    }
    
    // Second overloaded method with varargs of double
    static void display(double... values) {
        System.out.println("double varargs method");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        display(); // This call is AMBIGUOUS
    }
}
