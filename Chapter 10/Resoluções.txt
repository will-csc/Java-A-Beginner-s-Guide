Chapter 10 Self Test

1. Why does Java define both byte and character streams?
R: Because can be two types of characters, 16-bit and byte

2. Even though console input and output is text-based, why does Java still use byte streams for
this purpose?
R: Java's use of byte streams because it ensures compatibility with various platforms

3. Show how to open a file for reading bytes.
R: 
try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filePath)) {
            int byteData;
            while ((byteData = fis.read()) != -1) { // Read byte by byte
                System.out.print((char) byteData); // Convert and print character
            }

4. Show how to open a file for reading characters
R: 
String filePath = "example.txt"; // Path to the file

        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader(filePath)) {
            int charData;
            while ((charData = fr.read()) != -1) { // Read character by character
                System.out.print((char) charData); // Print the character
            }

5. Show how to open a file for random-access I/O.
R: 
try (RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(filePath, "rw")) { // Open for read/write
            // Writing data to the file at specific positions
            raf.writeUTF("Hello, World!"); // Write a string

            // Move the file pointer to the beginning
            raf.seek(0);

            // Reading data from the file
            String message = raf.readUTF();
            System.out.println("Read from file: " + message);

            // Move to a specific position and overwrite part of the file
            raf.seek(7);
            raf.writeUTF("Java!");

            // Move back and read again
            raf.seek(0);
            System.out.println("Updated content: " + raf.readUTF());

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error handling the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }

6. How can you convert a numeric string such as "123.23" into its binary equivalent?
R: 
String numStr = "123"; // Numeric string
        int num = Integer.parseInt(numStr); // Convert to integer
        String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(num); // Convert to binary

What type of stream is System.in?
R: InputStream

10. What does the read( ) method of InputStream return when the end of the stream is
reached?
R: -1

11. What type of stream is used to read binary data?
R: Byte Stream

12. Reader and Writer are at the top of the ____________ class hierarchies
R: character stream

13. The try-with-resources statement is used for ___________ ____________ ____________.
R: automatically closing resources.

14. If you are using the traditional method of closing a file, then closing a file within a finally block is generally a good approach. True or False?
R: True
